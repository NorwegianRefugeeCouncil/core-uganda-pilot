# How to run this (for now)


1. cd into `api/client`
2. `npm i`
3. `go run .` to generate a `models.ts` file
4. `tsc`
5. cd into `api`
6. `make serve`
7. cd into `api/frontend`
8. create `.env` file with the following content:
```
NODE_ENV='development'
SERVER_HOSTNAME='<your-local-ip>:9000'
```
10. `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install` (if you don't have yarn you can install it with `npm i -g yarn`
11. `yarn start` will spin up expo and should open the Expo dev tools in a browser window
12. Click "run in web browser" in the left-hand menu, or press `w` in the terminal to open the web frontend
13. If you have a terminal emulator you can also open that via the same menu or `a` in terminal
14. Finally, if you have installed the Expo app on your _Android_ phone, you should be able to open the mobile app by scanning the QR code generated by expo
15. If things aren't reacting, try pressing `r` in the terminal to reload/recompile the apps
