# How to run this (for now)

from the repo root directory:

`make build`

this will bootstrap everything.

Then, with the server running in another terminal (`make serve`) run:

`make frontend`


You can also start the frontend directly from its directory with yarn:

`yarn start` or `yarn web`/`yarn android` to launch the app directly.
