First make sure you've [setup your development environment](README.md) properly :)

# Issues and pull requests

_Everything_ goes through PRs, no commits to main (unless it's a tiny thing or a noop, in which case validate with a colleague first)!

When starting on an issue, create a branch from `main` and give it a descriptive name starting with the issue number on Jira. ie `COR-454-Fix_everything`
